Pints & Pixels

Find your way to your new favorite brew!

Pixels & Pints is a way to find and save a drink, no matter your location. Fueled by wanderlust and the desire to share a pitcher among friends, group Ichiban created Pixels and Pints for the everyday person, the average person who wants to find something new.

Pints & Pixels uses geolocation with Open Brewery DB and MapBox API to find your next adventure. Here's how it works:


In the search bar, enter the city you want to explore.

After your search, a list of results will pop up showing: 
<ul><li>Name of Beer establishment</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Establishment's website</li>
<li>Click the add button to save this place for your future night out</li>
<li>Click the trash button to remove a place</li></ul>

Be safe & enjoy!
